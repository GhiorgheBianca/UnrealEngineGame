# UnrealEngineGame
Features:
- sphere objects follow and hit the player
- sphere objects can be destroyed by shooting at them

We use Artificial Intelligence to move the spheres. <br>
The project uses Blueprints and the main code is constructed on the Event Graphs. <br>
You can find the objects in Content/Blueprints.
